Simulation of binary self-propelled particles inside a closed wall

The aim is to simulate the motion of Binary Self-propelled particles inside a closed wall (especially of spherical and cylindrical nature). 
It is done to study the behavioral and interaction patterns of the two particles present in the same environment. The expected behaviour seen
is that when two different types of particles interact with each other they tend to form groups or small clusters within themselves, due 
to their inherent separate nature of self propulsion.

Practically, we can see this as an example of two different kinds of microorganisms inside a fluid, one of which is spherical
and one of which is rod shaped, then observing the clustering of those. While they would interact with each other, we would be able to find 
clustering behaviours between them.
